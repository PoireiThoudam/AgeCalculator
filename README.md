# AgeCalculator
# Age Calculator 🧮

This is a simple Java program that helps you calculate your age based on your birth date. You just have to enter your birth year, month and day, and it will tell you how many years, months and days old you are. 😄

## 💻 How it works?

The program uses Java's built-in `LocalDate` and `Period` classes from `java.time` package to calculate the age. It also handles some basic validation like future dates and invalid date inputs.

### 👨‍💻 Tech Used:
- Java
- Scanner (for input)
- LocalDate and Period (for age calculation)

## ✅ How to Run?

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer (Java 8 or above is good).
2. Copy the code from `AgeCalculator.java` file.
3. Open your terminal or any IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).
4. Compile and run the file:

```bash
javac AgeCalculator.java
java AgeCalculator
